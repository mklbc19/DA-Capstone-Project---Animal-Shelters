Comparing the differences in animal shelter intake/outtake nationwide to Louisville, KY

Using data from the years 2021-2023, I would like to compare the differences between shelter intkaes and outtakes nationwide to the Louisville database to see if the city is on the same trend nationwide or different.  I would like to compare the types of intakes, outcomes, and overall number in aaa given set of years.

I researched similar populations in regards to Louisville and the 50 states.  Base on research, Wyoming, Vermont and Alaska is the most similar in population to Louisville, KY.  I think data from those states could be used for one comparison.
