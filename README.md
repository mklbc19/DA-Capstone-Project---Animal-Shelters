# DA-Capstone-Project---Animal-Shelters
Data Analysis Project
Overview
The project is my capstone project for CODE:You. I am going to compare the animal shelter intakes/outtakes between Louisville, KY and Dallas, TX.  After that, I am going to see how that compares to the nationwide numbers.  

Data
I used three datasets in this project. Each lists numbers/incidences of intake and outakes.  I have one for Louisville, Dallas, and Nationwide.
Louisville Animal Shelter Data: https://data.louisvilleky.gov/datasets/louisville-metro-ky-animal-service-intake-and-outcome/about
Nationwide Animal Shelter Data: https://www.shelteranimalscount.org/data-request-free-download/
Dallas Animal Shelter Data: https://www.dallasopendata.com/Services/Dallas-Animal-Shelter-Data-Fiscal-Year-2022-2023/f77p-sgrc/about_data

I researched similar populations in regards to Louisville and the 50 states.  Base on research, Wyoming, Vermont and Alaska is the most similar in population to Louisville, KY.  I think data from those states could be used for one comparison.
